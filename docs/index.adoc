Authenticate using OIDC and JWT tokens

== Intro

This application will act as an OIDC Relying Party for your Enonic XP instance. It verifies the identity of End-Users based on your OIDC Authorization Server or JWT token.

Browser-based visitors are redirected to the Authentication Server, and once successfully authenticated, a user will be created in Enonic XP.

API or machine-based clients can authenticate using OIDC JWT tokens.

== How it works

The ID provider supports two different approaches:

* Authorization Code Flow using `client_secret_post`, `client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_jwt` methods.
* Auto login based on Authorization header with a JWT Bearer Token for Stateless Authentication.

It is possible to mix the two authentication methods for a single domain/vhost.
